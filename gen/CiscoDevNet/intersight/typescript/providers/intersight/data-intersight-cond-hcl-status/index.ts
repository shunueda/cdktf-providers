Therefore there can be only one validation reason. "Incompatible-Server" - the server model is not listed in the HCL. "Incompatible-Processor" - the server model and processor combination is not listed in HCL. "Incompatible-Firmware" - the server model, processor and server firmware is not listed in HCL. "Missing-Os-Info" - the os vendor and version is not listed in HCL with the HW profile. "Incompatible-Os-Info" - the os vendor and version is not listed in HCL with the HW profile. "Incompatible-Components" - there is one or more components with "Not-Validated" status "Service-Unavailable" - HCL data service is unavailable at the moment (try again later). "Compatible" - the server and all its components are validated. "Not-Evaluated" - The server is not evaluated against the HCL because it is exempted.
  * * `Missing-Os-Driver-Info` - The validation failed becaue the given server has no OS driver information available in the inventory. Either install UCS Tools VIB on the host ESXi or use OS Discovery Tool scripts to provide proper OS information.
  * * `Incompatible-Server` - The validation failed for this server because the server's model was not listed in the HCL.
  * * `Incompatible-Processor` - The validation failed because the given processor was not listed for the given server model.
  * * `Incompatible-Os-Info` - The validation failed because the given OS vendor or version was not listed in HCL for the server PID and processor combination.
  * * `Incompatible-Firmware` - The validation failed because the given server firmware was not listed in the HCL for the given server PID, processor, OS vendor and version.
  * * `Service-Unavailable` - The validation has failed because HCL data service is temporarily not available. The server will be re-evaluated once HCL data service is back online or finished importing new HCL data.
  * * `Service-Error` - The validation has failed because the HCL data service has returned a service error or unrecognized result.
  * * `Not-Evaluated` - This means the HclStatus for the sever has not been evaluated because it is exempted.
  * * `Incompatible-Components` - The validation has failed for this server because one or more components have "Not-Listed" status.
  * * `Compatible` - The validation has passed for this server's model, processor, OS vendor and version.
