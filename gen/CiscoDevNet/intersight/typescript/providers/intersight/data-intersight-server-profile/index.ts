In this scenario, the derived vNIC update displays this error.

This error type is considered fatal and not retried.For example, when a new policy is attached to a server profile template, the sync to a derived server profile fails due to the policy attach errors.
  * * `User` - Any configuration error due to incorrect or invalid input and that requires user intervention for correction, is displayed under this category. This error type is considered fatal and not retried.For example, when a new policy is attached to a server profile template, the sync to a derived server profile fails. This happens when the policyis not applicable to the server assigned to the server profile, such as the Power policy that is not applicable for UCS Rack servers.
