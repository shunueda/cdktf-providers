A Failed node can be reached when the last executed task has failed or timed out and there are no further retries available for the task. Also as per the workflow design, the last executed task did not specify an OnFailure task to be executed and hence by default, the execution will reach the Failed node. Actions like "Rerun", "RetryFailed" and "RetryFromTask" can be issued on failed workflow instances. Please refer to the "Action" description for more details.
  * * `Terminated` - A workflow execution moves to Terminated state when user issues a "Cancel" action or due to internal errors caused during workflow execution. e.g. - Task input transformation has failed. Terminated is a final state of the workflow, no further action are allowed on this workflow instance.
  * * `Canceled` - A workflow execution moves to Canceled state when a user issues a "Cancel" action. Cancel is not a final state, the workflow engine will issue cancel to all the running tasks and then move the workflow to the "Terminated" state.
  * * `Paused` - A workflow execution moves to Paused state when user issues a "Pause" action. When in paused state the current running task will complete its execution but no further tasks will be scheduled until the workflow is resumed. A paused workflow is resumed when the user issues a "Resume" action. Paused workflows can be canceled by user.
